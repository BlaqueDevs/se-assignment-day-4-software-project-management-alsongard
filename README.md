answer question1:
time delivery ensures that the project is develivered on time. The product is releases to the market by the organization for use by customers or to address a given problem
project managers can use a time schedule in Project proposal to provide a detail view of how the project modules and phases are to be accomplished.

answer question 2:
By providing an overview of the cost/budget of the product, this ensures that the project funds are used wisely, or correctly for each resource needed for the project. E.g hardware. 
Project Managers can use budget table in Project Proposal to provide a view of the needed cost for each resource required by the project.

answer quesiton 3:
Agile is an iterative, flexible approach to software development, emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback, and quick delivery of functional software in small increments (called sprints) while waterfall method s a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next.
Agile Method in SE:
Advantages:
    Flexibility to adapt to changes.
    Faster delivery of working software.
    Continuous feedback from stakeholders.
    Higher collaboration among team members and with clients.
    Lower risk of project failure due to iterative progress and ongoing evaluations.

Disadvantages:
    Can be difficult to predict timelines and costs due to the evolving nature of work.
    Requires high levels of collaboration, which can be time-consuming.
    Might not work well for teams or projects with unclear requirements.
    Potential for scope creep if not properly managed.

Waterfall method in SE:
Advantages:
    Clear and well-defined stages of work, making it easier to understand timelines and costs.
    Works well for projects with stable and clear requirements.
    Easy to manage due to its structured approach.
    Easier to measure progress since all tasks are planned upfront.

Disadvantages:
    Rigid; difficult to accommodate changes once the process is underway.
    Delayed delivery of working software, as it’s released only at the end.
    Less collaboration with stakeholders during development.
    Risk of not meeting client needs if requirements change after project initiation.


answer quetion 4:
Agile Method is needed in projects with evolving requirements: Software projects where requirements may change or evolve, such as mobile app development, web development, or startups needing to adapt quickly to market demands.
Example:
Social Mobile Application which requires changes or updates due to user feedback.

Waterfall Method is used in rojects with well-defined requirements: Projects with a clear and stable scope, such as construction projects, hardware development, or certain government projects.
Example:
Operating System or a bank application.

answer question 5:
Quality assurance (QA) is critical to ensure that the software meets the required standards, is free from bugs, and performs as expected.

Some methods include:
Automated Testing: Using tools to run predefined tests that check for functional, performance, and security issues.
Manual Testing: Human testers evaluate the user interface, user experience, and functionality of the software.
Code Reviews: Regular peer reviews of the codebase to catch errors and ensure coding standards are maintained.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Integrating code frequently and deploying it automatically to test environments to catch issues early.
User Testing: Getting real user feedback during beta testing or after deployment to identify pain points and ensure the software addresses user needs.

Maintaining high standards is important to ensure that the software is reliable, meets user expectations, and is scalable. It also minimizes the risk of post-release defects that could lead to reputational damage or financial loss.

answer question 6:
Defining the project scope is vital because it establishes clear boundaries for the project, outlining what will and will not be included. This helps prevent scope creep, ensures the project remains focused, and enables effective resource management.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into smaller, manageable components or tasks. 
The WBS helps to:
Break down complex projects into smaller tasks
Clearly assign responsibilities
Create an accurate timeline
Identify potential risks
Track progress

A WBS is useful because it ensures that all aspects of the project are covered, and nothing is overlooked, improving the accuracy and success of the project plan.

answer question 7:
Benefits of Developing a Detailed Project Schedule and Gantt Charts
A detailed project schedule provides clarity on the timeline, dependencies, milestones, and resource allocation.

Benefits include:
Better resource management
Clear expectations for team members
Identification of bottlenecks or delays early
Improved stakeholder communication
A roadmap for monitoring progress and ensuring timely delivery

Gantt charts are useful because they visually represent the project schedule. They show tasks, durations, dependencies, and progress, making it easier to manage timelines and coordinate resources effectively.

answer question 9:
Clearly defining the problem allows for a more focused, user-centered software solution. 
 Identify specific pain points
 Design a solution that directly addresses user needs
 Avoid building unnecessary features
 Ensure a more efficient development process

A well-defined problem also makes it easier to measure success and gather relevant user feedback during testing phases.

answer quesiton 10:
To describe the software solution without getting too technical, you  focus on its benefits and outcomes. 
This captures the software’s essence, highlighting user benefits, while leaving out the technical details.

answers question 11:
Key differentiating features might include:

 User-friendly interface: Simple and intuitive for non-technical users.
 Customization: Ability to tailor features to fit unique business needs.
 Cross-platform compatibility: Works seamlessly across devices and operating systems.

These features set your software apart from competitors by offering unique value and enhancing user experience.

answer question 12:
Market data, such as reports on industry growth, trends, and competitive analysis, helps identify the software's potential. Sources like Gartner, Statista, or industry-specific reports can provide insights into the size and expected growth of the market, including:

 Current market value and forecasted growth rates
 Demographics of potential customers
 Emerging market trends
 Competitive landscape and gaps

answer question 13:
Market trends provide insight into shifting customer needs, technological advancements, and competitive pressures. Understanding trends like AI integration, mobile-first solutions, or cloud computing can help:
 Position the software as forward-thinking and relevant
 Adapt the software to emerging user demands
 Differentiate the product from competitors by addressing gaps in the market
 Inform development priorities (e.g., prioritizing mobile compatibility or data security)
